this is a poem 
by me to shut you up
your daddys waiting for you by your  crib with that small baby cup
dont fight meaningless wars with me 
kids  like you need to go home
learn from you momma who acts to be fearsome
you are worse than a whole plot of trash dump 
now go away lil shorty , and use your height pump
